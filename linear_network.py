        This is a good place to create the target network, setup your

        You should use the mean_huber_loss function as your
        loss_function. You can also experiment with MSE and other
        losses.

        The optimizer can be whatever class you want. We used the

        You will probably want to vary your behavior here based on

        UniformRandomPolicy.

        If you're testing, you might want to use a GreedyEpsilonPolicy

        should update your network parameters based on the current

        Inside, you'll want to sample a minibatch, calculate the
